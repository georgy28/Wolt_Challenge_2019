# Wolt Challenge 2019
## 

I found out about this [Wolt Coding Task 2019](https://github.com/woltapp/summer2019) challenge
and since currently I am studying Python I decided to give it a try.

The output is a map (rather than a .csv file) which opens on a browser automatically 
including all the details (used the folium package) plus 
You can enable/disable the different layouts on the map by clicking the top right icon on the generated map.

For now the solution is just a jupyter notebook file.
The next step will be to use tkninter for a more user friendly input of different values.

Please feel free to fork it and improve it!
