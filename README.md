# Wolt Challenge 2019
## 

I found out about this [Wolt Coding Task 2019](https://github.com/woltapp/summer2019) challenge
and since currently I am studying Python I decided to give it a try.

The output is an html page with a map (rather than a .csv file) which opens automatically on the browser 
including all the required details plus more. Just hover the mouse on top of the circle markers
or click on the larger markers. You can enable/disable the different layouts on the map by clicking on the top right icon on the generated map.

For now the solution is just a jupyter notebook file.
The next step will be to use tkninter for a more user friendly input of different values.

Please feel free to fork it and improve it!
